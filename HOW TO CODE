## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `Pillow`, `numpy`

You can install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install Pillow numpy
Running the Script
Clone the repository or download the script.

Open a terminal and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python image_encryption.py
Enter the path to your input image when prompted.

Example:

arduino
Copy
Edit
Enter the path to the image file: C:\Users\YourName\Pictures\image.png
📸 Example
Original → Encrypted → Decrypted

You should see:

encrypted_image.png (randomly scrambled version)

decrypted_image.png (restored original)

⚠️ Notes
This is a demonstration of a simple encryption mechanism and not suitable for secure cryptographic use in real-world applications.

Ensure the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.
